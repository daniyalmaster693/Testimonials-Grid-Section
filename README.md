<h2> What have I learned </h2>

<li> Learned some basic things about CSS Grid </li>
<li> Learned about using Grid to position elements </li>
<li> Learned about the property grid area </li>
<li> Further practiced my responsive design skills </li>

<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating all the HTML elements and assigning them classes. Next, I started to work on the cards, where I added things like box shadows, background images, and padding. Then, I moved onto the text, where I spent time getting the colors, sizes, and styles right. I then moved onto the top of the cards, where I used proprties such as Display: flex, and margin to get the spacing and design right. Once I was down styling the cards, I moved onto the layout. I used flexbox properties on the body, to get everything centered horizontally and vertically. Once, I was done, I learned about some basic grid properties, as this was my first project using and learning about grid. I used things like grid template columns, to create my layout. I had some difficulty dealing with the second row, and the long card, as they would be spaced further away, ruining the layout. I spent some time experimenting, writing things out, and reworking my HTML, until I fixed my issue. Once I finished, I tested the website on multiple browsers, added some responsive design using media queries, and used the built-in device size emulation feature to view what the website would look like on different devices. </p>
